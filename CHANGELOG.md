## [4.2.0] - 2024-03-15

### Updated
- Rule: named-return-values rule was renamed to gas-named-return-values and now it is part of Gas Consumption ruleset
- Rule: custom-errors rule was renamed to gas-custom-errors and now it is part of Gas Consumption ruleset


## [4.1.2] - 2024-02-06

### Updated
- Update references in package json [#530](https://github.com/protofire/solhint/pull/530)
- Parser support up to Solidity 0.8.22 (*)

(*) Note: Solhint can work with latest Solidity versions. 
          If new grammar/syntax is added or changed, it could give some false positives or miss a rule. 
          But overall functionality will work as expected.

## [3.6.1] - 2023-08-11

### BREAKING CHANGE
- RULE: `not-rely-on-time` was REMOVED from RECOMMENDED ruleset<br>
This was long overdue.<br> 
Beware!! If you are relying on this rule and it is not explicitly configured (meaning there's only `solhint:recommended` option).<br>
You should add this rule manually:
```json
  {
    "extends": "solhint:recommended",
    "rules": { 
        "not-rely-on-time": "warn", 
        "compiler-version": "off" 
    },
  }
```
If not explicitly added, this rule will not be executed.

### SPECIAL ATTENTION
- RULE: `compiler-version` default was updated from ^0.5.2 to ^0.8.0


### Updated
- Rule: `check-send-result` added config clarification in the new `Notes` section [#482](https://github.com/protofire/solhint/pull/482)
- Rule: `compiler-version` default was updated from ^0.5.2 to ^0.8.0 [#483](https://github.com/protofire/solhint/pull/483)

### Added
- New Rule: Enforces the use of Custom Errors over Require and Revert statements [#475](https://github.com/protofire/solhint/pull/475)
- New Rule: Enforces the test_ prefix on a file for Foundry users [#476](https://github.com/protofire/solhint/pull/476)
- New Rule: Enforces the naming of function return values [#478](https://github.com/protofire/solhint/pull/478)
- `Notes` option on docs to add more information of each rule. See `foundry-test-functions`. [#476](https://github.com/protofire/solhint/pull/476)

### Fixed
- `func-named-parameters` - false positives on builtin functions [#472](https://github.com/protofire/solhint/pull/472)
- `ordering` - treat initializer weight same as constructor [#474](https://github.com/protofire/solhint/pull/474)
- `check-send-result` - false positive on `erc777.send()`` function [#477](https://github.com/protofire/solhint/pull/477)
- `explicit-types` - default value is now taking into account when no value is specified in config [#481](https://github.com/protofire/solhint/pull/481)
- `compiler-version` - default value is now taking into account when no value is specified in config [#483](https://github.com/protofire/solhint/pull/483)
